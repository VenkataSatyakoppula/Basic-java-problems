EXERCISE-1

1. Write a Java program to display all the prime numbers within a range.
2. Write a Java program to print the following patterns by reading the number of lines from the user.
i) 
```console
*
**
***
****
*****
ii)    *
      * *
     * * *
    * * * *
   * * * * *
   iii)
         *
        * *
       * * *
      * * * *
       * * *
        * *
         *
 ```
3 Write a Java program to sum up all the digits of an integer till the sum is a single digit.
 ```console
   Eg: INPUT  9985 
           9+9+8+5 = 31
           3+1 = 4
           OUTPUT  4
  ```      
4 Find whether an entered number is CIRCULAR PRIME or not. Display YES if it is a circular prime, otherwise display NO. A circular prime number is a number that remains prime on any cyclic rotation of its digits (in base 10). 
For example 1193 is circular prime because 1931, 9311, 3119 and 1193 are all prime numbers.
